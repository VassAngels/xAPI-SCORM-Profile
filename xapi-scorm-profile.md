## 1.0 Purpose
The xAPI was created in response to the eLearning communityâ€™s desire to modernize the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) capabilities, which was initially developed to make courseware interoperable with learning management systems. Since its introduction in 2000, SCORM has played a critical role in the proliferation of online training and education courses. The Experience API (xAPI) introduces a new paradigm for tracking and recording learning-related data. We can track learners as they perform work tasks, produce work outputs, communicate, collaborate, and engage in just about any other online activity. This API uses a flexible data format that supports many different use cases and needs. However with this flexibility arises the need for developers to formalize the data they track and what that data means. By formalizing the data reported by content and the format of that data, tools can be created that can make sense of that data.

The Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) community is one area that could benefit from providing a formalized method for compiling and formatting learner experiences. Using the xAPI and the guidance contained within this profile, developers can create xAPI statements that can be interpreted by any other system that understands the guidelines described in this document. This will support the integrity and consistency of the data across SCORM content and provide a base vocabulary needed for interpreting and reporting on that data.
