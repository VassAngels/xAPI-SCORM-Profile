## 1.0 Purpose
The xAPI was created in response to the eLearning communityâ€™s desire to modernize the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) capabilities, which was initially developed to make courseware interoperable with learning management systems. Since its introduction in 2000, SCORM has played a critical role in the proliferation of online training and education courses. The Experience API (xAPI) introduces a new paradigm for tracking and recording learning-related data. We can track learners as they perform work tasks, produce work outputs, communicate, collaborate, and engage in just about any other online activity. This API uses a flexible data format that supports many different use cases and needs. However with this flexibility arises the need for developers to formalize the data they track and what that data means. By formalizing the data reported by content and the format of that data, tools can be created that can make sense of that data.

The Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) community is one area that could benefit from providing a formalized method for compiling and formatting learner experiences. Using the xAPI and the guidance contained within this profile, developers can create xAPI statements that can be interpreted by any other system that understands the guidelines described in this document. This will support the integrity and consistency of the data across SCORM content and provide a base vocabulary needed for interpreting and reporting on that data.

## 2.0 When to Use this Profile
SCORM is well established and accepted in many organizations around the world as the interoperable way to deliver and track web-based learning content. If the traditional LMS and content model is working for your organization, there is no need to change to use the xAPI.

However there are use cases that are difficult if not impossible to meet with SCORM. These cases prompted ADL to begin looking for alternative options. The initial effort resulted in the xAPI specification. It was intended to resolve issues such as:
- SCORM assumes content is managed and launched by an LMS (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, 2012, p. RTE-2-7).
  - Not all content can be contained and managed by an LMS, such as video games, virtual worlds, and simulators.
- SCORM embeds its API in a web page (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, 2012, p. RTE-3-28). 
  - Not all content is web-based content. In cases where the content is not web-based, finding the SCORM API is not defined, like mobile apps and platform-based games.
- SCORM has a strictly defined data model (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, 2012, p. RTE-4-3).
  - Not every learning experience fits neatly into that model - things like tracking altitude in a flight simulator, or how many times a user paused a video does not translate into the SCORM data model.
- SCORM tracking only applies for an individual learner (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, 2012, p. RTE-2-5).
  - Group learning and interactions cannot be recorded with SCORM.
  - Data about instructors, tutors, mentors and peers cannot be stored with SCORM.
- SCORM does not provide guidance on how to get data back out of an LMS (Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, 2012, p. RTE-2-5).
  - The interface described in SCORM only exists during the life of a sharable content object (SCO) communication session. There is no SCORM API that exists outside of that communication session.
  - Reporting and data access requirements are not standardized in SCORM resulting in proprietary, LMS-specific, reporting functionality that can differ between vendors.

## 3.0 How to Use this Profile
This document is intended to be used in addition to the xAPI specification. All communication, data formats and experiences shall follow the requirements in the xAPI specification. The guidance provided in this document is to add information specifically to support SCORM communications in xAPI format.
